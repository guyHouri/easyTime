the app has five main aspects.
the first - the login and sign up.
in the app there is a list of users that is automaticlly save by json so a user can close the app and reopen it and enter to his user.

secondly - the event log.
in the event log a user can create an event type - that has the variables: date and time (uding dateTimePickerDialog), type (friends, scoutsm friends), and a location (which i'll expand on later). in this page of the app the user can add events and the app will display them for him.

thirdly - the map (to choose where will be the location of an event). 
thier will be a map displayed for the user and he can search for a location and pick it.

the fourth main aspect in the app is the missions list. in the mission list the user will be avle to create missions and put in when is the due date and if the mission is urgent or not. the mission list will display in this page and the user can check mission and it will be checked as done.
